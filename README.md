# react-ssr
Custom react server sided rendering setup with Redux implementation. This is an MVP that I created for Pathways and wanted to test my skills at implementing server-sided rendering and Redux into a React application.

In order to run this project, you will also need to clone the react-ssr-api repository and run them both at the same time. Make sure you have ports 3000 and 3001 open for services to communicate with each other.

This project features the following:
- Server-sided rendering
- Redux state management
- Cookie-based authentication
- Chart.js
- Twitter API

### How to run
1. Navigate to the project folder
2. Run `npm install` from the command line to install project dependencies
3. Run `npm start` from the command line to build the project and start the server
